Project Overview:
This project demonstrates multithreading, synchronization, and deadlock handling in C#. The project is divided into four different phases, each stage builds off of the next one. 
- Phase one: Basic threading operations - creating and managing threads.
- Phase two: Resource protection - uses mutex locks for safe resource access.
- Phase three: Deadlock creation - demonstrates multi-threading deadlocks.
- Phase four: Implements timeouts, resource ordering, and deadlock prevention.
To demonstrate these techniques, the project simulates bank transactions. Specifically, when multiple threads try accessing and transferring funds between accounts. 

Step-by-step instructions:
To ensure a proper build and run the code you'll need to:
- Ensure you have either Git or .NET SDK downloaded
- If GitHub is being used, then clone the repository
- Compile the project, if successful then an output "Build succeeded" will appear.
- Finally, run the program
Once the program is running, the user will then be prompted to select a phase from 1-5. Each number contains a different phase.

Dependencies and installation instructions:
Some dependencies for running this program would be ensuring that your compiler supports .NET 7.0+ and that you have git installed. 
Installation instructions:
- Download .NET SDK from Microsoft's .NET download page.
- Install the SDK following the on-screen instructions
- Verify the installation process by running the program.
